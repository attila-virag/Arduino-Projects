Robot Arm Project

Summary

We have built a robot arm that has 4 degrees of freedom and can be controlled with a controller using two analog sticks.
The brains of the robot is a programmable microcontroller and the robot moves using 4 servo motors.

Definitions

Degrees of Freedom

In mechanics, a degree of freedom is a direction in space in which a body can rotate. A body that has 6 degrees of freedom can rotate in any direction in 3D space.
Our robot arm only has 4 degrees of freedom as we have drawn our diagram.

Microcontroller

The microcontroller is the brains of the robot. It is a small computer that has pins which can be used for input or output. We can attach devices to the pins and program our
microcontroller with instructions what to do with the devices. My dad programmed the microcontroller to transalte our control inputs to movements of the servo motors.

Servo Motor

A servo is an electric motor that can be rotated to a precise angle. We use the servo motors to control all the joints of our robot.
