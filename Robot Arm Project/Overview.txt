This project is based on a homeschooling robotics project I have done with my kids.

We are building a robotic arm using an Adruino Uno microcontroller, 4 servo motors and two joysticks.
We will control the arm using 2 joysticks and we will program the adruino to translate our joystick inputs into servo motor outputs which controls the arm. 
The adruino can be programmed using C/C++ programming language.


Project 1:

We are familiarizing ourselves with the adruino IDE and writing simple code that results in an led blinking output.

Project 2:

We are writing code that moves our servo motor back and forth.

Project 3:

We are writing code that records our joystick inputs and prints the x and y position values out on the screen

Project 4:

We are testing code that translates out joystict inputs to servo motor outputs

Project 5:

We are preparing our 4 servos with the initial angle values at which we will need that to build our robot in the initial position

Project 6:

The final version of the code that translates our control inputs to robot arm movements.
